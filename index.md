I'm a passionate developer working mainly with mobile and embedded systems.  
 
I have experience in iOS, Android, Xamarin, various embedded architectures, C#, Javascript, C & C++.  
I'm currently focusing on iOS development and I have a good eye for project management: having the big picture in my mind helps me plan tasks efficently in the great scheme of things.  

I love everything related to programming and technology in general and I'm a supporter of the [hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture). 

Below you will find some projects I've worked on in my spare time. Feel free to check them out.
